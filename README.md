## 1. Simple RAG

One of the most common use cases of Generative AI is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). 
RAG applications are tools that combine AI language models with real-world information sources to give better answers. 
They use a “retrieval” step to fetch facts or data from documents, websites, or databases and then “generate” answers using AI. 
This makes them more accurate and up-to-date compared to regular AI models that rely only on training data. 
RAG is great for tasks like answering questions, summarizing documents, or helping with research. 
It bridges the gap between advanced AI and real-time, fact-based knowledge.

You can learn more about RAG with the help of below video by Underfitted:
